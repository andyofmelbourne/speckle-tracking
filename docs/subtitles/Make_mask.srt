1
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:07,00
select the "make_mask" tab

2
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:09,00
the data input location is good.

3
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:12,00
the generated mask will be put in the "speckle_tracking" group of the cxi file

4
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:15,00
click the "Run" button and you should see the progress indicated in the terminal

5
00:00:15,00 --> 00:01:10,00
you might want to skip the video forward to 1:10:00...

6
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:19,00
clicking on the "view_h5_data_widget" tab, then clicking "update" you can see the location of the generated mask

7
00:01:20,00 --> 00:01:25,00
to manually edit the mask, select the "mask maker" widget in the "Process" menu

8
00:01:26,00 --> 00:01:29,00
adjust the colour scale as needed

9
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:33,00
blue pixels are masked, clicking on them will toggle the masked state

10
00:01:35,00 --> 00:01:40,00
clicking "next frame" will cycle through the frames in the dataset

11 
00:01:41,00 --> 00:01:45,00
in this case I don't see any more bad pixels so we don't need to click "save mask"
