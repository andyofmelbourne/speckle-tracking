1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,00
click "update_pixel_map" in the "Process" tab

2
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:13,00
change the search window from 10 to 20 pixels

4
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:22,00
since we don't have a pixel map yet, set this to "None"

5
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:30,00
increase the filter parameter, since this is the first update

6
00:00:31,00 --> 00:01:06,00
you can skip to 1:06...

7
00:01:07,00 --> 00:01:21,00
after adjusting the colour scale we can see an imperfect pixel map
