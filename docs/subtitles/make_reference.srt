1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,00
click "make_reference" in the "Process" tab

2
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:10,00
check the default values

3
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:12,00
we don't have a pixel_map estimate yet...

4
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:20,00
so we should set this to "None"

5
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:23,00
we have already generated a "good_frames" list

6
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:38,00
it's in the /frame_selector/good_frames dataset, so let's enter that

7
00:00:39,00 --> 00:00:43,00
click the "Run" button

8
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:53,00
after a while we should see the generated image

9
00:00:54,00 --> 00:00:59,00
adjust the colour scale (values of -1 are for un-assigned values in the map)

10
00:00:59,00 --> 00:01:10,00
looking closely one can see artefacts in the image due to the lens aberations
