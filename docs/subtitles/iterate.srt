1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,00
select the "make_reference" tab

2
00:00:05,00 --> 00:00:14,00
now that we have a pixel mapping estimate enter the location here

4
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:18,00
click the "Run" button

5
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:31,00
we can see that after one update cycle, the reference image is much improved

6
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:35,00
now let's update the pixel map again

7
00:00:35,00 --> 00:00:39,00
but we should decrease the filter parameter to (say) 5 pixels

8
00:00:39,00 --> 00:00:50,00
and be sure to update the existing pixel mapping

9
00:00:51,00 --> 00:01:24,00
you can skip to 1:24...

10
00:01:25,00 --> 00:01:30,00
the updated pixel map now looks better

11
00:01:31,00 --> 00:01:35,00
so let's update the reference again

12
00:01:36,00 --> 00:01:45,00
all the settings are good, so just run it

13
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:49,00
now we can see some minor improvement to the reference image

14
00:01:49,00 --> 00:01:55,00
so let's update the pixel map again, but with a lower filter

15
00:01:56,00 --> 00:02:26,00
you can skip to 2:26...

16
00:02:27,00 --> 00:02:35,00
so let's update the reference image, again...

17
00:02:36,00 --> 00:02:45,00
and update the reference again, with a smaller filter...

18
00:02:50,00 --> 00:03:20,00
you can skip to 3:20...

19
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:26,00
this process can be repeated until there is no change in the pixel mapping
