1
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:7,00
add speckle tracking bin to the path

2
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:13,00
open the gui

3
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:23,00
select the "show / select frames" widget tab

4
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:25,00
mouse wheel zooms and click and drag pans the image

5
00:00:25,00 --> 00:00:29,00
the same applies for the colour scale widget

6
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:37,00
dragging the yellow bar selects different data frames. This also changes the "blue dot" in the top right panel.

7
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:45,00
the first frame is blank, so let's remove it

8
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:52,00
click on the offending frame in the top right panel

9
00:00:53,00 --> 00:00:56,00
then, click on "write to file"

10
00:00:56,00 --> 00:00:59,00
click on the "view_h5_data_widget" tab and click "update" to refresh the list

11 
00:00:59,00 --> 00:00:64,00
we can see that a new dataset has been created that starts at frame 1 (rather than 0)
